# Covid19_EDA_and_Modelling
With the call for code, I wanted to analyze the rate at which the Coronavirus is spreading by country. Is it possible to develop a model that can predict the number of confirmed cases by day for all the countries in the world? If so I think itd be pretty cool to get my hands dirty with some code and data, tackling this complex problem.
